I studied both front-end and back-end development at a coding academy. Since the project was created with less than a month of knowledge in front-end development, it is still quite incomplete.


My first project was based on a Japanese singer's festival site. The reference page had only one index page, and I built all the front-end work based on that. I implemented most of the necessary features for the project, with 70% done by myself and 30% with the help of AI. For the script part, I received 100% assistance from AI, but I thoroughly understood and interpreted the code, making it my own.


Although it was my first project and the code is somewhat complex and difficult, this experience has improved my understanding of CSS and front-end development. In the future, I am confident that I can maintain better consistency in CSS and write cleaner, more efficient code.
